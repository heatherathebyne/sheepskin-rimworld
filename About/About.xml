  <description>Sheep now produce sheepskin when butchered. Sheepskin is slightly more protective and insulating than sheep wool, at the cost of... well... the sheep.

Vanilla sheep are boring. Sure, you get wool, but there are better wools. Sure, you get meat, but you get dull plainleather when you slaughter them. Why not get a special product out of them instead?
